**Getting Started with IBM Cloud Functions**

IBM Cloud Functions (based on Apache OpenWhisk) is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform which executes functions in response to incoming events and costs nothing when not in use.

**Runtimes**

Work with what you already know and love. Develop your functions directly in one of the natively supported languages, or run code in any other language (including compiled Go, C, etc. binaries) by providing us with a Docker container.

									**Why Cloud Functions is used?**
**Serverless Backends**
	
Expose application logic by implementing serverless microservices. Simply map your functions to well-defined API endpoints any client can call by making use of Web Actions or our latest API Gateway integration.
