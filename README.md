**Getting Started with IBM Cloud Functions**

IBM Cloud Functions (based on Apache OpenWhisk) is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform which executes functions in response to incoming events and costs nothing when not in use.

**Runtimes**

Work with what you already know and love. Develop your functions directly in one of the natively supported languages, or run code in any other language (including compiled Go, C, etc. binaries) by providing us with a Docker container.

**Why Cloud Functions is used?**

**Serverless Backends**
	
Expose application logic by implementing serverless microservices. Simply map your functions to well-defined API endpoints any client can call by making use of Web Actions or our latest API Gateway integration.

**Data Processing**

Execute code whenever data is updated in your datastore. Easily automate processes like audio normalization, image rotation, sharpening, noise reduction, thumbnail generation, or video transcoding.

**Cognitive Data Processing**

Analyze data as soon as it becomes available. Let your function make use of powerful cognitive services like IBM Watson to detect objects or people appearing in images or videos.

**IoT Ready**

React to and process IoT sensor data. Let any IoT device send data to our IBM Watson IoT platform and define cloud rules to call your functions and execute custom application logic.

**Event Stream Processing**

Process data in-motion and make your functions react to incoming messages. Benefit from our IBM Cloud Message Hub—an IBM Cloud managed Apache Kafka—integration.

**Conversational Scenarios**

Implement serverless conversational applications, like chatbots, by passing chat messages to your functions for further processing.

**Scheduled Tasks**

Execute your functions periodically. Define schedules following a cron-like syntax to specify when actions are supposed to be executed.
